                    <h2>Our Founders</h2>
                    <p>New Treads Tire Co. was founded by two lifelong car enthusiasts who saw a need for faster, more convenient tire and maintenance service—without sacrificing quality. With years of hands-on experience in auto repair and a shared frustration with long wait times and impersonal shops, they set out to build something better.</p>
                    <p>What started as a mobile tire repair van quickly grew into a full-service operation focused on efficiency, transparency, and customer-first service. Today, they're still out in the field, shaking hands, turning wrenches, and making sure every job is done right. Because for them, it's not just about tires and oil—it's about trust, convenience, and keeping you safely on the road.</p>
                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>At New Treads Tire Co., our mission is simple: to make car care faster, easier, and more convenient for everyone on the road. We're redefining what it means to get reliable tire and maintenance service—by bringing it directly to your doorstep.</p>
                    <p>Through expert workmanship, honest pricing, and unmatched convenience, we aim to take the stress out of vehicle upkeep and keep our community rolling safely and confidently every mile of the way.</p>
